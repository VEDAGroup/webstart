Webstart Maven Plugin (VEDA Fork)
=================================
  
This is a fork of the Codehaus Webstart Maven Plugin 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT - http://mojo.codehaus.org/webstart/webstart-maven-plugin/
  
We need the ability to sign the embedded JNLP templates and a possibility to properly release a new version. For that reason we decided to fork the original project and release our changes.
